# Coding Projects

## Software Dev Foundations -- Java
In this course, we undertook a semester-long Connect4 coding project, which emphasized collaboration and applying foundational software development principles. My team and I gained experience in key areas, including:
- Writing proper documentation to ensure code clarity and maintainability.
- Implementing unit testing to validate functionality and maintain quality.
- Leveraging advanced programming techniques such as interfaces, abstract classes, factory patterns, and the observer design pattern.
- Hosting and managing our project using GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Below is the implementation of my project, showcasing the skills and concepts learned throughout the semester.

## Programing Methodology -- C++/C
This course provided a fast-paced introduction to programming in C and C++, along with foundational experience in the Unix/Linux operating system. We focused on structured programming, modular design, program testing, and algorithm analysis.
- Key takeaways from this course include:
- Learning the syntax and foundational principles of C and C++.
- Implementing structured programming techniques and modular design for efficient and maintainable code.
- Gaining familiarity with Unix/Linux, including command-line tools and workflows.
- Developing problem-solving skills through algorithmic thinking and testing methodologies.
Below is a showcase of my work, reflecting the skills and concepts learned throughout the course.
